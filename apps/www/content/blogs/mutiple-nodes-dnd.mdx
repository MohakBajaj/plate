## Introduction

In rich text editors, the drag-and-drop feature is often overlooked, yet it is crucial.

A good drag-and-drop interaction can significantly improve the efficiency of organizing and restructuring content. On the other hand, a poor experience may cause users to abandon the editor altogether.

Since Plate.js 49.0.8, the feel and success rate of drag-and-drop have improved significantly. However, some edge cases still reveal shortcomings in handling.

This article will take you through an in-depth analysis of the changes brought by this upgrade, as well as directions for future improvements.

## Upgrades to the Drag-and-Drop Experience

### More Stable Drag-and-Drop Logic

In previous versions, dragging block elements between other blocks often resulted in **failed drops or cursor misplacement**.

In 49.0.8, after a series of adjustments, drop zone detection has become smarterâ€”especially when adjacent blocks have similar heights, the judgment is much more precise, and failed drags are now rare.

### Smoother Interaction

Compared to the previous "laggy" experience where you had to try dragging several times, the new drag-and-drop feels much closer to Notion. You can clearly preview the insertion point, and feedback is immediate.

## Two Issues That Still Need Improvement

### Issue 1: Drops Fail on Margin-Top Areas

Currently, if there is a noticeable `margin-top` above the target block, users visually expect to be able to drop in that area, but the drop is actually ignored, breaking the experience.

This is because the insertion detection uses the actual block boundary, not its visible area.

**Suggested Solution:**
Consider incorporating margin perception when detecting drop positions, or allow the drop zone to extend outward by a few pixels.

### Issue 2: No Support for Dragging Multiple Blocks

The current version **only supports dragging a single block at a time**, which is insufficient when users need to quickly move a section (such as an H2 + paragraph + image).

Although you can work around this by temporarily grouping blocks, this is not an ideal experience.

**Ideal Behavior:**
- Select multiple blocks and drag them at once;
- Highlight the entire selection during the drag;
- After dropping, retain the original order and styles.

## Summary

Plate.js 49.0.8's drag-and-drop system has taken a key step forward, making the overall experience much closer to mainstream rich text editors like Notion.

However, to achieve truly "free and intuitive" drag-and-drop, it still needs:

- Support for dropping in edge whitespace areas;
- The ability to select and drag multiple blocks;
- More natural insertion animations and transitions.

If future versions continue to optimize these aspects, Plate's editing experience will move even closer to true WYSIWYG.

What you want to control is not just the content, but also the flow of its structure. Drag-and-drop interaction is the embodiment of that sense of control.
