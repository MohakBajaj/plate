We're excited to announce the release of Plate v40, a major milestone in our journey to create the most powerful and flexible rich text editor framework for React. This release brings significant improvements across the board, from performance optimizations to new AI-powered features.

## What's New in v40

### AI Integration

Plate v40 introduces first-class support for AI-powered writing assistance. With our new AI plugin, you can:

- Generate content with context-aware suggestions
- Transform and improve existing text
- Get intelligent autocomplete as you type
- Integrate with popular LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude

### Performance Improvements

We've made substantial performance improvements that make Plate faster than ever:

- 50% reduction in bundle size through better tree-shaking
- Optimized re-renders with improved memoization
- Lazy loading of plugins for faster initial load times
- Better handling of large documents with virtualization

### Redesigned Plugin System

The plugin system has been completely redesigned to be more intuitive and powerful:

```typescript
const MyPlugin = createSlatePlugin({
  key: 'myPlugin',
  handlers: {
    onKeyDown: ({ event, editor }) => {
      // Handle keyboard events
    },
  },
  render: {
    node: ({ children, ...props }) => (
      <MyCustomElement {...props}>{children}</MyCustomElement>
    ),
  },
});
```

### Enhanced Collaboration

Real-time collaboration is now easier than ever with our improved Yjs integration:

- Better conflict resolution
- Improved cursor and selection synchronization
- Support for offline editing with automatic sync
- New collaboration toolbar with user presence indicators
